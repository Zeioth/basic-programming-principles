# How to run this
Make sure you have python installed. On linux it comes pre-installed. But if you are on windows you have two options:

* Install python and run a terminal.
* Or in your windows, [enable the Linux Subsystem for windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ap3hL-UR9I). That way you have a linux terminal inside of Windows (recommended).

Now you can run the python program in your current directory like

``` shell
python hello_world.py
```
